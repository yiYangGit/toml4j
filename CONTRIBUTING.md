Thank you for taking the time to contribute to toml4j! Here are a few guidelines to streamline the process.

* Pull Requests should be opened against the wip branch. Master changes only when there is a new release.
* Cover new or modified functionality with unit tests. Run `mvn test jacoco:report` and look at `target/site/jacoco/index.html` to view code coverage.
* Amend README.md as necessary
* Update the UNRELEASED section of CHANGELOG.md, as described in [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com)
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Opening braces, parentheses, etc. are not on a new line

If you are unsure about how something should be implemented, open a pull request and we'll discuss it.
